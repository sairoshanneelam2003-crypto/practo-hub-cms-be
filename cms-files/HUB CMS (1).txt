Purpose
The Practo Hub CMS will be the single control room to manage the complete lifecycle of
doctor-led content — from upload → review → medical validation → editing → approval →
publishing → analytics.
It enables Practo to scale high-quality, compliant, AI-ready health content across categories and
creators.

Key Objectives
●​ Host & Manage all Practo Hub videos, articles, and assets.
●​ Streamline Workflow: Upload → Review → Approve → Publish → Track.
●​ Enable Medical Compliance: Every video passes through dual-layer validation
(Medical + Creative).
●​ Ensure Seamless App Integration: Direct publishing to the Practo Hub tab (in-app &
web).
●​ Power Analytics & AI: Structured metadata and tagging to drive personalization, future
AI summarization, and performance tracking.

CMS Workflow
Step 1 — Upload
●​ Doctor or Content Team uploads raw video or edited file.​
●​ Mandatory fields: Title, Doctor Name, Specialty, City, Language, Tags, Description, CTA
Type (Quiz / Consult / Vault), Related Category.​
●​ Auto-thumbnail & transcript generation (Phase 2).​

Step 2 — Medical Review
●​ Medical reviewer validates accuracy, tone, and disclaimers.​
●​ Uses checklist: no medical claims, correct dosage, clarity of explanation.​

Step 3 — Creative Editing
●​ Practo Creative team adds subtitles, VO/subtitles, Practo branding, and final visual
polish.​

Step 4 — Final Approval
●​ Dual-approval system (Medical + Content Head/CMO).​
●​ “Approved” status triggers ready-to-publish flag.​

Step 5 — Publishing
●​ Approved content pushed via API to Practo Hub app & web (ad-free custom player).​
●​ Option to cross-post teasers to Instagram/YouTube Shorts via link metadata.​
●​ Deep-link CTA (practo://hub/videoID) for social → app flow.​

Step 6 — Analytics
●​ Post-publish dashboard: view count, CTR, quiz completion, consult conversion.​
●​ Doctor-wise performance, specialty-level insights, average review time.​
